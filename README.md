# MComm

MComm is a simple, text based messenger. With the server application you can create a channel with an optional password that users of client application can join. Users have the option to choose their nickname when they join the server.

# Build

To build both server and client applications you need make installed on your linux machine. Once you have that it is as simple as running it in the same directory that the Makefile resides in. For now you need to manually create a directory called bin next to Makefile.
